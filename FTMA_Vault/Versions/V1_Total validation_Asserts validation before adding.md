# Notes
+ Every adding has to check if that estructure is posible.
	+ line adding
		+ non  $[l_i\cap l_j]>= 2$  (made in line adding)
		+ new points
		+ new triangles
		+ new segments
	+ segment adding
		+ triangle consistence.
		+ segment tree consistence
	+ angle adding
		+ triangle consistence
		+ figure consistence??
+ Angles and segments don't know each other (this means no trigonometric functions and no isosceles and equilateral triangle notice this is part of the algorithm)
# Work Flow

* Add a line
	* if two points are repeated in one line ask to replace it
	* adds points
	* create the line
	* associate the points with the lines
	* 
* Add a segment
* Add an angle
