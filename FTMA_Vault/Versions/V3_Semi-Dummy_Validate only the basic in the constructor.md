# Workflow
## add a line 
+ [x] if a line has two equal points
	+ [x] replace it and its points
	+ [x] explain why
+ [x] add it and add points
[[Line conflicts]]
## add a segment
+ [x] assert only positives
+ [x] then add it 
+ [x] add segment to triangle
	+ find the triangle dummy version
[[Segment conflicts]]
## add an angle
+ [x] assert only positives
+ [x] assert len == 3
+ [x] assert no grater than 180
+ [x] assert points exist
+ [x] add it
+ [x] add it to the triangle
[[Angle conflicts]]
## Notes
+ dummy triangles, not all are existing triangles (collinearity)

## Todos

- [x] Add lines
- [x] Add segment 
- [x] Add angles
